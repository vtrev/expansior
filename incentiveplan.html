          <h4>INCENTIVE PLAN</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            Our comprehensive <b>network marketing incentive program</b> uses a <b>3X10 matrix</b> to incentivise
            marketers for promoting
            iGen Education Trust. Once any of the people you have marketed iGen to decides to donate on a monthly basis,
            we
            will reward you for using your <b>time and effort</b> to support iGen’s mission. <b>The 3X10 matrix simply
              means you are
              allowed a maximum of three people directly under you but you will be incentivised up to ten levels
              deep.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you take part in the marketing program, it is important for you to read the
            <a href="https://member.expansior.co.za/files/Expansior_Pty_Ltd_TC.pdf" target="_blank">Terms and
              Conditions</a> affecting your involvement in the program. If you are satisfied with the information given,
            it is critical
            that you accept them for the system to allow you to proceed. When you sign up to register as an iGen donor,
            please choose <a href="http://www.igenedutrust.org.za/" target="_blank">Option 3</a> if you prefer to
            participate in the
            incentive program.
          </p>
          <p>The sections below fully explain how our 3X10 matrix works.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row incentive-levels">
        <div class="col s12 m12 l12">
          <h5>Level One</h5>
          <p>With the 3X10 matrix, our system will allow you to have a <b>maximum of three (3) people directly
              referred by you.</b> These people will be referred to as your direct downlines as they will be directly
            linked to you in our incentive matrix (see illustration in the Figure below).</p>
          <br>
          <img class="" src="./images/3x10matrix1.png" alt="" style="width: 50%;">
          <p>
            The illustration above shows a direct link between you, Thando, Nosie and Morné. This means that
            you would have personally promoted iGen to Thando, Nosie and Morné and they would have used your
            <b>Member ID (MID)</b> during their registration phase when up-line details were requested. These three
            people are also referred as your first level or <b>Level 1.</b> You will be paid monthly by Expansior for
            <b>each donor</b> you refer who decides to make a monthly donation to iGen. You don’t have to fill any level
            fully for you to be incentivised. You will be paid according to the number of people in your network
            regardless of whether all positions on a certain level are fully occupied or not. Your incentive will
            vary depending on the amount contributed by each donor in your team/network. However, it is important
            to note that each person can only have a maximum of three people directly linked to him/her.</p>
          <p>NB: For the payment algorithm to change, each level must be fully filled.</p>

          <div id="more-incentives-text" class="more-text animated fadeIn">
            <br>
            <h5>Level Two</h5>
            <p>The network marketing program allows those below you to also refer three donors under each one of them.
              This simply means that, using the illustration above, Thando can also refer three people who will be
              directly under him. Nosie and Morné also have an equal opportunity to do the same and market iGen to
              three other people each (see illustration below). <b>This means each of them will end up with three people
                under them, making a total of nine people on this level.</b></p>

            <p>This is referred to as your <b>Level 2,</b> but it will be level one for Thando, Nosie and Morne. Just
              like
              you,
              the three will be incentivised on a monthly basis for their referrals. However, since you personally
              referred Thando, Nosie and Morné, the system will still pay you the same amount you received earlier
              per person for the nine people referred by the people under you. This is because the system acknowledges
              that you are their indirect up-line (see digram below). The system only allows you a maximum of nine (9)
              people on Level 2.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/3x10matrix2.png" alt="" style="width: 80%;">
            <p>The system will pay you on the basis of a number of factors, i.e. the amount you are donating to
              iGen
              on a monthly basis, the amount donated to iGen by each of your downlines on a monthly basis, the
              number of active downlines you have in your team and the reduction formula used from level six
              to
              level ten as indicated in the terms and conditions (read your terms and conditions here).
              <br>
              <p>
                Due to the fact that there are <b>seven different monthly donation options</b> to choose from, i.e.
                <b>R100,
                  R300, R500, R800, R1,500, R3,000 and R5,000,</b> the incentive you are going to receive will vary
                depending on the combination of the factors mentioned above. The system has been designed to
                create
                an <b>accurate set of rules</b> to be followed in calculating these amounts. It takes all these
                factors
                into account and calculates the total amount to be paid into your account on a monthly basis.
                Unless
                you are contributing R100 and every other person in your network donates the same amount, it
                becomes
                literally impossible to estimate the amount you are likely to receive at the end of each month,
                until the actual time comes.</p>

              <p>Several sections below use the <b>assumption that every person in your network is contributing
                  the
                  same
                  amount</b> as yours for the donation options listed above. When such an assumption is made,
                it
                becomes
                possible to estimate the likely incentive to be paid to you and other marketers in your team.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h5>Level Three</h5>
              <p>Level 3 of the network is dependent on the number of people on Level 2. If each person on Level 2
                promotes iGen and encourages others to join in and do the same, the nine people on Level 2 will each
                have
                three people directly under them. This will lead to a total of 27 downlines on Level 3 (see diagram
                below).
                However, many people are less likely to limit themselves to only three downlines. Many are more likely
                to
                encourage more than three people to support iGen. Since each person can only structurally have a maximum
                of
                three people directly under them, then the additional people will have to be given to downlines who do
                not
                have any person under them or who have less than 3 people under them.</p>
              <br>
              <img src="./images/3x10matrix3.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;">
              <p>This will lead to an interesting and empowering phenomenon explained in detail in the next section.</p>
              <br>

              <h5>Spill-overs</h5>

              <p>
                Due to the nature of the matrix, it is almost certain that members will receive spill-overs from
                their up-lines. <b>Spill-overs happen when those above you refer more people who sign up to donate
                  than the three (3) that they are expected to.</b> This leads to you receiving marketers under you who
                will belong to your network even though you never personally marketed to them. It also maximises
                the amazing <b>power of leverage</b> and helps to grow your team, and inevitably your incentive,
                phenomenally.
                As a result, you don’t only benefit from your own efforts and the efforts of those below you, but you
                also benefit from the hard work of those above you. This is teamwork, or rather ubuntu, at its best. It
                is illustrated in the diagram below:</p>

              <img src="./images/spillover.png" alt="" style="width: 80%;">
              <p>
                In the diagram, all the red individuals are spill-overs from up-lines of the different marketers.
                Person 1 only successfully marketed iGen to person 4, but also received persons 9 and 10 from you as
                his up-line. This means that you, as the up-line, referred more people than the 3 expected on your
                level 1. It will continue for as long as those above you keep referring people who end up registering
                to support iGen and make their monthly donations.</p>

              <p><b>You will be able to earn revenue from the referral fees of people you have not personally
                  referred,</b>
                and highly likely people you do not know but who were successfully referred to iGen by your different
                up-lines.</p>

              <p>Each donation option carries its own incentive amount, with R100 per month carrying the lowest and
                R5000
                per month
                carrying the highest. <b>The amount you choose to donate determines the level at which you will be
                  incentivised.</b> If you
                choose to donate a lower amount, i.e., R100 pm, you will be incentivised as per the R100 option. If you
                choose to
                donate a higher amount, i.e., R5000 pm, you will be incentivised far much more per person, depending on
                the donation
                level of each person in your team.</p>
              <br>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12 m12 l12">
          <h5>Multiple donations</h5>
          <p>Our system allows you to <b>donate as many times as you desire.</b>
            You may choose to donate the same R100 several times or donate different
            amounts several times. It is important to note that each donation will be
            treated differently and as such, each donation will build its own matrix.
            This will also help you maximise benefits if you intend doing so. Take note,
            however, that this simply means you will have several debit orders running off
            your account on a monthly basis. You are free to choose any donation option.</p>
          <br>
          <h5>Upgrades</h5>
          <p>It is possible to increase your donation to a higher level any time of the month.
            Increased contributions will also lead to an increase in the incentive received.
            Upgrades happen in two different ways, as detailed below:
          </p>
          <p><b>Automatic upgrades(involuntary) </b></p>
          <p>These are upgrades which will happen <b>involuntarily and automatically</b> to each iGen donor
            the moment your incentive is ten times more than your donation. Involuntary upgrades will
            continue happening until you reach the highest donation option of R5,000 per month. As you
            generate more revenue from the communal network, it is our desire that you also contribute more
            towards iGen.</p>
          <p><b>Manual upgrades (voluntary)</b></p>
          <p>These upgrades happen <b>voluntarily and manually</b>. As a donor, you will have to manually
            log into your back office and follow the steps given to upgrade to a level of your choice.
            The benefit of manual upgrades is that you can personally choose to increase your donation
            to any amount given among the options available.</p>
          <br>

          <h5>Downgrades</h5>
          <p>As much as it is possible to upgrade, the system allows downgrading from a higher donation
            option to a smaller one. It is important to note that <b>this is not permissible to individuals
              who are generating more than ten times the amount they are contributing</b> (as explained above).
            This option is open to those donors who contribute more money monthly than the incentive they
            receive and later feel the need to reduce the amount they are donating, or simply find themselves
            unable to maintain a monthly debit order of a certain amount. Such donors do have the liberty to
            downgrade to any level (lowest being R100) which may seem affordable to them. They can always
            opt to increase their donation at any point in time.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col l12 m12 s12">
          <h5>Incentive estimates</h5>
          <p>
            The amounts paid per person per month may seem rather small
            to you and many other people, but if you consider the fact
            that your team grows from <b>collective effort</b> and not individual
            effort, you will appreciate the power behind this strategy.
            Many network marketing companies tend to focus more on the
            power and ability of individual network marketers to recruit
            and keep other marketers. Such companies tend to pay reasonably
            huge commissions on a monthly basis, but they fail to realise
            two very important factors, i.e., 1) that not every person out
            there is a network marketer who is adept at recruiting, and 2)
            that an individual’s efforts can only benefit him or her so much
            in a day.

          <h6>Incentive calculation for Floe - R100pm donation</h6>
          <p>For the R100 donation option, you will be paid <b>R3.04 per person per month</b>from level one to
            five for each person who is in your network, regardless of the amount contributed by your
            downlines or the amount contributed by any of the spill-overs. The algorithm changes from level
            6-10. <b>Your remuneration is determined by the
              amount
              you
              donate.</b> See below for a table (only levels 1-5) indicating what you are likely to
            receive, assuming each person in your network will be contributing R100 per month. The
            calculation would be straightforward if the amounts remained at R100 throughout the donation
            period. However, that is less likely to happen as amounts will continuously vary due to the
            individual amounts which members of your team may choose to donate as well as the built-in
            automatic upgrade facility.</p>

              For every R100 amount contributed by each donor to iGen, R19.00 will be set aside for
              marketing.
              20% of the R19.00, i.e. R3.80 will be set aside for the running of the marketing company and
              80%
              of the R19.00, i.e, R15.20 will be set aside for the compensation of marketers. All

              As you can evidently see from the table above, the incentive program already pays you more
              than
              your donation amount by the time you complete level 3, or by the time you have 39 marketers
              in
              your team. By the time you reach the end of level 5, the program will be incentivising you
              with
              an amount which is more than ten times the amount you are donating to iGen. Simply put, a
              mere
              R100 donation to iGen on a monthly basis has the potential to help you generate over R1,000
              per
              month through the Expansior incentive program.<b> This is indeed incontrovertible proof that
                blessed is the hand that gives than the one that takes.</b>
              <br>
              For other amounts above R100.00, see the relevant tables below. Please, bear in mind that
              the
              calculations made here assume that every person is contributing the same amount on a
              particular
              donation option. This is highly unlikely as different people will opt to donate different
              amounts.

            <p>For the R5,000.00 donation option, you will be paid <b> R152.00 per person per month </b>from
              level one to five for each person who is in your network. In cases where a downline or a
              spill-over contributes less than R5000 per month, i.e. R3000, you will be paid according to the
              donation option of that person (R91.20 per person per month).The algorithm changes from level
              6-10. <b>See the table below </b> (only levels 1-5) indicating what you are likely to receive,
              assuming each person in your network will be contributing R5,000 per month. The calculation
              would be straightforward if the amounts remained at R5,000 throughout the donation period.
              However, that is less likely to happen as amounts will continuously vary due to the individual
              amounts which members of your team may choose to donate as well as the built-in automatic
              upgrade facility.</p>

              <p>
                For every R5,000.00 amount contributed by each donor to iGen, R950.00 will be set aside for
                marketing. 20% of the R950, i.e. R190.00 will be set aside for the running of the marketing
                company and 80% of the R950.00, i.e, R760.00 will be set aside for the compensation of
                marketers. All marketers who successfully encourage other people to donate to iGen will be
                incentivised using a 3X10 matrix as partially indicated in the table above.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you can evidently see from the table above, the incentive program already pays you more
                than
                your
                donation amount by the time you complete level 3, or by the time you have 39 marketers in
                your
                team.
                By the time you reach the end of level 5, the program will be incentivising you with an
                amount
                which
                is more than ten times the amount you are donating to iGen. Simply put, a R5,000 donation to
                iGen on a
                monthly basis has the potential to help you generate over R50,000 per month through the
                Expansior
                incentive program. <b>This is indeed incontrovertible
                  proof that
                  blessed is the hand that gives than the one that takes.</b>
