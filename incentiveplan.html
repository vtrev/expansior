          <h4>INCENTIVE PLAN</h4>
          <br>

          <p>
            Our comprehensive <b>network marketing incentive program</b> uses a <b>3X10 matrix</b> to incentivise
            marketers for promoting
            iGen Education Trust. Once any of the people you have marketed iGen to decides to donate on a monthly basis,
            we
            will reward you for using your <b>time and effort</b> to support iGen’s mission. <b>The 3X10 matrix simply
              means you are
              allowed a maximum of three people directly under you but you will be incentivised up to ten levels
              deep.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you take part in the marketing program, it is important for you to read the
            <a href="https://member.expansior.co.za/files/Expansior_Pty_Ltd_TC.pdf" target="_blank">Terms and
              Conditions</a> affecting your involvement in the program. If you are satisfied with the information given,
            it is critical
            that you accept them for the system to allow you to proceed. When you sign up to register as an iGen donor,
            please choose <a href="http://www.igenedutrust.org.za/" target="_blank">Option 3</a> if you prefer to
            participate in the
            incentive program.
          </p>
          <p>The sections below fully explain how our 3X10 matrix works.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <div class="row inncentive-levels"></div>

      <div class="row incentive-levels">

        <h5>Level One</h5>
        <p>With the 3X10 matrix, our system will allow you to have a <b>maximum of three (3) people directly
            referred by you.</b> These people will be referred to as your direct downlines as they will be directly
          linked to you in our incentive matrix (see illustration in the Figure below).</p>
        <br>
        <img class="" src="./images/3x10matrix1.png" alt="" style="width: 50%;">
        <p>
          The illustration above shows a direct link between you, Thando, Nosie and Morné. This means that
          you would have personally promoted iGen to Thando, Nosie and Morné and they would have used your
          <b>Member ID (MID)</b> during their registration phase when up-line details were requested. These three
          people are also referred as your first level or <b>Level 1.</b> You will be paid monthly by Expansior for
          <b>each donor</b> you refer who decides to make a monthly donation to iGen. You don’t have to fill any level
          fully for you to be incentivised. You will be paid according to the number of people in your network
          regardless of whether all positions on a certain level are fully occupied or not. Your incentive will
          vary depending on the amount contributed by each donor in your team/network. However, it is important
          to note that each person can only have a maximum of three people directly linked to him/her.</p>
        <p>NB: For the payment algorithm to change, each level must be fully filled.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Level Two</h5>

        <div class="more-text">
          <br><br>
          <p>The network marketing program allows those below you to also refer three donors under each one of them.
            This simply means that, using the illustration above, Thando can also refer three people who will be
            directly under him. Nosie and Morné also have an equal opportunity to do the same and market iGen to
            three other people each (see illustration below). <b>This means each of them will end up with three people
              under them, making a total of nine people on this level.</b></p>

          <p>This is referred to as your <b>Level 2,</b> but it will be level one for Thando, Nosie and Morne. Just like
            you,
            the three will be incentivised on a monthly basis for their referrals. However, since you personally
            referred Thando, Nosie and Morné, the system will still pay you the same amount you received earlier
            per person for the nine people referred by the people under you. This is because the system acknowledges
            that you are their indirect up-line (see digram below). The system only allows you a maximum of nine (9)
            people on Level 2.</p>

          <br>
          <img src="./images/3x10matrix2.png" alt="" style="width: 80%;">
          <p>The system will pay you on the basis of a number of factors, i.e. the amount you are donating to
            iGen
            on a monthly basis, the amount donated to iGen by each of your downlines on a monthly basis, the
            number of active downlines you have in your team and the reduction formula used from level six
            to
            level ten as indicated in the terms and conditions (read your terms and conditions here).
            <br>
            <p>
              Due to the fact that there are <b>seven different monthly donation options</b> to choose from, i.e.
              <b>R100,
                R300, R500, R800, R1,500, R3,000 and R5,000,</b> the incentive you are going to receive will vary
              depending on the combination of the factors mentioned above. The system has been designed to
              create
              an <b>accurate set of rules</b> to be followed in calculating these amounts. It takes all these
              factors
              into account and calculates the total amount to be paid into your account on a monthly basis.
              Unless
              you are contributing R100 and every other person in your network donates the same amount, it
              becomes
              literally impossible to estimate the amount you are likely to receive at the end of each month,
              until the actual time comes.</p>

            <p>Several sections below use the <b>assumption that every person in your network is contributing
                the
                same
                amount</b> as yours for the donation options listed above. When such an assumption is made,
              it
              becomes
              possible to estimate the likely incentive to be paid to you and other marketers in your team.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Level Three</h5>
            <p>Level 3 of the network is dependent on the number of people on Level 2. If each person on Level 2
              promotes iGen and encourages others to join in and do the same, the nine people on Level 2 will each have
              three people directly under them. This will lead to a total of 27 downlines on Level 3 (see diagram
              below).
              However, many people are less likely to limit themselves to only three downlines. Many are more likely to
              encourage more than three people to support iGen. Since each person can only structurally have a maximum
              of
              three people directly under them, then the additional people will have to be given to downlines who do not
              have any person under them or who have less than 3 people under them.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/3x10matrix3.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;">
            <p>This will lead to an interesting and empowering phenomenon explained in detail in the next section.</p>
            <br>

            <h5>Spill-overs</h5>

            <p>
              Due to the nature of the matrix, it is almost certain that members will receive spill-overs from
              their up-lines. <b>Spill-overs happen when those above you refer more people who sign up to donate
                than the three (3) that they are expected to.</b> This leads to you receiving marketers under you who
              will belong to your network even though you never personally marketed to them. It also maximises
              the amazing <b>power of leverage</b> and helps to grow your team, and inevitably your incentive,
              phenomenally.
              As a result, you don’t only benefit from your own efforts and the efforts of those below you, but you
              also benefit from the hard work of those above you. This is teamwork, or rather ubuntu, at its best. It
              is illustrated in the diagram below:</p>

            <img src="./images/spillover.png" alt="" style="width: 80%;">
            <p>
              In the diagram, all the red individuals are spill-overs from up-lines of the different marketers.
              Person 1 only successfully marketed iGen to person 4, but also received persons 9 and 10 from you as
              his up-line. This means that you, as the up-line, referred more people than the 3 expected on your
              level 1. It will continue for as long as those above you keep referring people who end up registering
              to support iGen and make their monthly donations.</p>

            <p><b>You will be able to earn revenue from the referral fees of people you have not personally
                referred,</b>
              and highly likely people you do not know but who were successfully referred to iGen by your different
              up-lines.</p>

            <p>Each donation option carries its own incentive amount, with R100 per month carrying the lowest and R5000
              per month
              carrying the highest. <b>The amount you choose to donate determines the level at which you will be
                incentivised.</b> If you
              choose to donate a lower amount, i.e., R100 pm, you will be incentivised as per the R100 option. If you
              choose to
              donate a higher amount, i.e., R5000 pm, you will be incentivised far much more per person, depending on
              the donation
              level of each person in your team.</p>
            <br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h5>Incentive estimates</h5>
      <p>
        The amounts paid per person per month may seem rather small
        to you and many other people, but if you consider the fact
        that your team grows from <b>collective effort</b> and not individual
        effort, you will appreciate the power behind this strategy.
        Many network marketing companies tend to focus more on the
        power and ability of individual network marketers to recruit
        and keep other marketers. Such companies tend to pay reasonably
        huge commissions on a monthly basis, but they fail to realise
        two very important factors, i.e., 1) that not every person out
        there is a network marketer who is adept at recruiting, and 2)
        that an individual’s efforts can only benefit him or her so much
        in a day.</p>
      <br>
      <h5>Multiple donations</h5>
      <p>Our system allows you to <b>donate as many times as you desire.</b>
        You may choose to donate the same R100 several times or donate different
        amounts several times. It is important to note that each donation will be
        treated differently and as such, each donation will build its own matrix.
        This will also help you maximise benefits if you intend doing so. Take note,
        however, that this simply means you will have several debit orders running off
        your account on a monthly basis. You are free to choose any donation option.</p>
      <br>
      <h5>Upgrades</h5>
      <p>It is possible to increase your donation to a higher level any time of the month.
        Increased contributions will also lead to an increase in the incentive received.
        Upgrades happen in two different ways, as detailed below:
      </p>
      <br>
      <h6>Automatic upgrades (involuntary)</h6>
      <p>These are upgrades which will happen <b>involuntarily and automatically</b> to each iGen donor
        the moment your incentive is ten times more than your donation. Involuntary upgrades will
        continue happening until you reach the highest donation option of R5,000 per month. As you
        generate more revenue from the communal network, it is our desire that you also contribute more
        towards iGen.</p>
      <br>
      <h6>Manual upgrades (voluntary)</h6>
      <p>These upgrades happen <b>voluntarily and manually</b>. As a donor, you will have to manually
        log into your back office and follow the steps given to upgrade to a level of your choice.
        The benefit of manual upgrades is that you can personally choose to increase your donation
        to any amount given among the options available.</p>
      <br>

      <h5>Downgrades</h5>
      <p>As much as it is possible to upgrade, the system allows downgrading from a higher donation
        option to a smaller one. It is important to note that <b>this is not permissible to individuals
          who are generating more than ten times the amount they are contributing</b> (as explained above).
        This option is open to those donors who contribute more money monthly than the incentive they
        receive and later feel the need to reduce the amount they are donating, or simply find themselves
        unable to maintain a monthly debit order of a certain amount. Such donors do have the liberty to
        downgrade to any level (lowest being R100) which may seem affordable to them. They can always
        opt to increase their donation at any point in time.</p>
